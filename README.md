We have 8 years of historic health data taken from various devices including: Fitbit, Apple Watch and iPhone. <br>
This valuable data encompassed crucial metrics including step count, heart rate, exercise time, and energy burned.

### In this project we will train 2 model
1. Neural Network
2. Ensemble Model (Tree Based)
    1. Decision Tree
    2. Rnadom Forest
    2. ADA Boost
    3. Gradient Boost
    4. XGBoost
    
**So Let's get started with our eyes wide open Or..!!**
